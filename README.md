### What was I aim for while I was building this app?

- Learning sockets, rest APIs, sending images, react hooks, props. 
- Comprehend the localStorage and use this on my app. 
- Understanding the backend part that chatengine built for us.
- Create something useful that everyone can run.
- Interact with people and share ideas on how to make this app
